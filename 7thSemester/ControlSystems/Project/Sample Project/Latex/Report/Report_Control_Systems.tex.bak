\section{Problem which is considered}
\noindent Perform the following for E2.13 at Page 82:\\
a. Obtain state-space representation for the system (without obtaining any transfer function). \\
b. Choose the output matrix as you like (except identity matrix - and make the system observable). \\
c. Check the stability of the system using all methods that you know.\\
d. Compute the controllability and observability for the system. If the system is controllable, place the controller poles at (-3, -5) and observer poles at a location which is faster than the controller poles.\\
e. Simulate the system using observer based feedback controller and show all the responses.

\section{Solution}
In this report, we address the the above problem and explain each subproblem in detail.


\subsection{State-space Representation of the System}
The state-space representation of the system can be written as follows:
\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix} \dot{x_1}\\  \dot{x_2} \end{bmatrix}
= \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 \\
3 & 4  \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} x_1\\  x_2 \end{bmatrix} +
\begin{bmatrix}
5 & 6 \\
13 & 7  \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} u_1\\  u_2 \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
y=\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\ -0.3
\end{bmatrix}x
\end{equation}

If the state-space for your problem is not obtained, obtain it. Mention the state-space here in this section.


\subsection{Stability analysis of the system}
In this section, we analyze the stability of the system. The stability can be checked using different ways namely eigen values, step response, poles, root locus and RH-stability criteria. For our case, the system is of 2nd order and therefore there will be two eigen values. Let $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ denote the eigen values of the system. The values of eigen values can be written as follows:
\begin{equation} \lambda_1 = 3,  \lambda_2 = -20 \end{equation}

As we can see one of the eigen value is positive, which indicates the system is unstable. Next, we verify the same fact by observing the poles of the system. Let $p_1$ and $p_2$ denote the poles of the system. The values for poles are as follows:
\begin{equation} p_1 = 3,  p_2 = -20 \end{equation}


We observe here again that one of the poles is positive, which indicates the system is unstable. Next, we verify the same fact by seeing the step-response of the system. The step-response of open-loop system is shown in Figure 1.

Next, the same fact can be obtained using Routh Hurwitz Table.
